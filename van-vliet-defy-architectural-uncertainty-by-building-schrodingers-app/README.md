## Bio

Peter started his career as a full-stack software developer in 2002 and has since progressed to a lead architect role. Over the course of these 20+ years, he has fulfilled many roles in various industries and gained extensive experience with a wide range of technologies such as Java, C#, JavaScript, and others. Nowadays, he leverages his expertise to assist companies, write articles, and speak at conferences.

His main focus is on making software development more cost-efficient and future-proofing applications. Additionally, he has picked up making illustrations as a hobby because he is a strong believer in visual communication. There are no boring slides in any of his presentations. 

## Abstract

Can an application be a monolith and microservices at the same time? Spoiler alert: yes!

In this session, we will explore a TypeScript codebase that defies the traditional boundaries. Much like Schrödinger's famous thought experiment, the application exists in multiple states simultaneously during development, but it's true form is only revealed at the moment of deployment. We'll uncover tools that empower developers to dance between monoliths and microservices, embracing the fluidity of development.

Whether you're a seasoned developer, a curious architect, or simply excited about the future of software, this session is for you. So, buckle up as we dive into the unknown, question the status quo, and redefine the boundaries of what's possible in modern application development.
